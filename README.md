# meteor-accounts-shibboleth
> A meteor accounts package for SAML/Shibboleth.

This package configures a service provider to connect the meteor accounts package with a shibboleth Idp. 
It sends SSO and SLO requests with an HTTP-Redirect binding. 
It currently works when using [samltest.id](https://samltest.id/) as the identity provider. 
Please note that I am not a cryptographer. Until this package is subjected to code review you’ll need to use it at your own discretion.

## Installation

Inside your package:

```sh
meteor add meteor-accounts-shibboleth
meteor add accounts-password
```

## Settings

The follwing attributes must be present in meteor settings for this package to work:

- `spSamlCert` - * *Required* * - The public key for your service provider.
- `spSamlKey` - * *Required* * - The private key for your service provider.
- `entryPoint` - * *Required* * - The HTTP-Redirect bound SSO entry point for your Idp.
- `logoutUrl` - * *Required* * - The HTTP-Redirect bound SLO url for your Idp.
- `idpMetadataUrl` - * *Required* * - The url where your Idp's metadata file can be accessed.
- `idpCert` - * *Required* * - The public certificate that can be used to validate your Idp's signature.
- `issuer` - The url where your application is running. If not set, this will default to the ROOT_URL environment variable.

- `generateUsers` - (Boolean) When true, users who authenticate but do not have an entry in the Meteor Users collection will have an entry created.
- `authFields` - (Object) Contains a dbfield and fname that are used to customize the how the users colleciton is queried to find the authenticated user.
- `authFields.dbfield` - Key value of the query that matches a path on a meteor users object.
- `authfields.fname` - Key value that matches a path on the profile object constructed from the login response. A more detailed explination can be found in the 'notes' section below.

## Usage example

For an example I recommend you clone [a meteor example app]( https://github.com/meteor/simple-todos-react.git) and remove the accounts ui and add ‘login’ and ‘logout’ buttons with the following onClick handlers: 

```javascript
handleLogin = () => {
    const provider = 'shibboleth-idp'
    Meteor.loginWithSaml({ provider }, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err)
      }
      // ...
    })
  }

handleLogout = () => {
  const provider = 'shibboleth-idp'
  Meteor.logoutWithSaml({ provider }, (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err)
    }
    // ...
  })
}
```

Before you can start configuring your service provider you will need to [generate a public/private key pair]( https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/InCFederation/Key+Generation). These will be spSamlCert/spSamlKey.

In in your server folder create a folder called 'lib' and in that folder create a file named 'settings.js'. and add the following code. 

```javascript
Meteor.settings = {
    "public": {
        "debug": true,
    },
    "saml": {
        "provider": "shibboleth-idp",
        "generateUsers": true,
        "authFields": {
          "dbname": "email.addresses",
          "fname": "email"
        },
        "spSamlCert": '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<Your public cert>-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n',
        "spSamlKey": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----<Your Private Cert>-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "entryPoint": "https://samltest.id/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO",
        "logoutUrl": "https://samltest.id/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SLO",
        "idpMetadataUrl": "https://samltest.id/saml/idp",
        "issuer": "your-domain.com",
        "idpCert": '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<samltest.id Idp signing cert>-----\n'
    }

}
```
Fill in spSamlCert and spSamlKey with the public/private keys that you generated. Replace issuer with your domain (I recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) if you're using localhost).  

Finally add samltest's signing cert which can be found [here](https://samltest.id/download/) in the 'SAMLtest's Idp' section's connection information. Note that your keys should contain the all of the newline characters. I got tripped up on cert formatting a couple of times so I left samltest.id's current signing cert below as an example.

```javascript
"idpCert": '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----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\n3kXPjhSfj1AJGR1l9JGvJrHki1iHTA==\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n'
```

in server/main.js add the following line:
```javascript
import './lib/settings'
```

You will need to [upload your service provider metadata to samltest.id's Idp](https://samltest.id/upload.php). Your metadata URL will be `https://<your-domain.com>/_saml/metadata/shibboleth-idp`. 

With this you should be able to use the login and logout buttons to authenticate with samltest's Idp. If you did not set `generateUsers` to true in your settings, you will need to create an account for the dummy users where `email.addresses` on the user object is equal to the email address given by samltest.

## Notes
* You may run into issues attempting to do this with localhost. I recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to forward traffic to localhost and use the generated forwarding address as your issuer.

* The 'dbname' and 'fname' fields in the 'authFields' object will be used to query the user's collection for the authenticated user as seen below:

  ```javascript
  Meteor.users.findOne({dbname: profile[fname]})
  ```
  where profile is not the user profile but an object that potentially contains the following fields:  
  `uid` - The userId likely used for sign in  
  `nameID` - Given the binding that this package uses this is the user's email. It will be stored on the user's object in the users collection and used as a session identifier when signing the user out.  
  `mail` - The user's email  
  `email` - Also the user's email  
  `eduPersonPrincipalName` - This corresponds to a user's 'netid' and is provided by some Idp's. You will not see this in samltest's login response.

  Leaving `authFields` out of the meteor settings will by default query the users collection with any/all of these attributes if they are present in the login response.

* If you run into any issues [samltest's Idp logs](https://samltest.id/logs/idp.log) are a good place to start troubbleshooting.

* It is only necessary to include Meteor's accounts-password package if `generateUsers` is set to true.

* I have not yet implemented signature validation on logout, although the signatures are validated when authenticating a user.
